# NEXUS Project Status
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-16

## ✅ Phase 0: Repository Reorganization (COMPLETE)

### Accomplished
- ✅ Reorganized entire codebase into professional package structure
- ✅ Created `neutron/` package with 8 submodules:
  - `core/` - Data models
  - `optimization/` - Hyperparameter search
  - `training/` - Ray trainers
  - `orchestration/` - Temporal workflows
  - `tracking/` - Cost tracking
  - `integration/` - DAG bridges
  - `cli/` - Command-line interface
  - `gui/` - GTK GUI
- ✅ Created comprehensive test structure (`tests/`)
- ✅ Updated all build configurations (pyproject.toml, Makefile, justfile, flake.nix)
- ✅ Updated documentation (README.md)
- ✅ Removed duplicate files (training.py consolidated)
- ✅ Removed empty directories

### New Package Structure
```
neutron/
├── cli/           # Command-line interface
├── core/          # Data models & configuration
├── gui/           # GTK GUI
├── integration/   # External integrations
├── optimization/  # Hyperparameter search
├── orchestration/ # Temporal workflows & workers
├── tracking/      # Cost tracking & budget validation
└── training/      # Ray actors for model training

## 🎯 Current Status: Ready for Phase 1

### Strategic Documents Created
1. **[ROADMAP.md](../../../ROADMAP.md)** - Canonical workspace roadmap
2. **PHASE1_QUICKSTART.md** - Detailed Week 1-4 implementation guide
3. **NEXUS.md** - Vision and architecture (existing)

### Immediate Next Steps
**NOW**: Begin Phase 1 - SENTINEL Implementation

**Timeline**: Weeks 1-4
**Objective**: Build compliance guardrail engine

---

## 📋 Phase 1 Checklist

### Week 1: Architecture & Setup
- [ ] Create `neutron/compliance/` module structure
- [ ] Design `ComplianceGuardrail` API
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL audit tables
- [ ] Write SENTINEL design doc

### Week 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Implement `sentinel.py` core engine
- [ ] Implement `audit_logger.py`
- [ ] Create `ComplianceViolation` exceptions
- [ ] Unit tests for core engine

### Week 3: LGPD Auditor
- [ ] Implement `auditors/lgpd.py`
- [ ] LGPD Article 18 guardrail
- [ ] LGPD Article 20 guardrail
- [ ] Integration tests

### Week 4: Integration & Demo
- [ ] Integrate with existing workflows
- [ ] Create demo script
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] **MILESTONE**: Live demo of compliance enforcement

---

## 🏗️ Future Phases (Weeks 5-16)

### Phase 2: CORTEX + SYNAPSE (Weeks 5-8)
- Multi-agent coordination with PBFT consensus
- Episodic memory with pgvector
- 3 specialized agents coordinating

### Phase 3: ORACLE + Multi-Regulation (Weeks 9-12)
- Ensemble reasoning engine
- GDPR, AI Act, SOC2 auditors
- Compliance dashboard

### Phase 4: Polish & Series A (Weeks 13-16)
- NixOS deployment module
- Demo application
- Series A pitch deck

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Technical
- [ ] All imports work: `from neutron.core.models import PipelineConfig`
- [ ] CLI commands installed: `neutron`, `neutron-worker`, etc.
- [ ] Tests pass: `pytest tests/ -v`
- [ ] Build succeeds: `poetry build`

### Strategic
- [ ] SENTINEL blocks non-compliant outputs (Week 4)
- [ ] 3 agents coordinate successfully (Week 8)
- [ ] Multi-regulation compliance working (Week 12)
- [ ] Series A pitch ready (Week 16)

---

## 🚀 Quick Commands

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Start infrastructure
docker-compose up -d

# Start worker
python -m neutron.orchestration.worker

# Run pipeline
python -m neutron.cli.main 1
```

### Phase 1 Start
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/sentinel-phase1

# Create module structure
mkdir -p neutron/compliance/auditors tests/compliance/auditors

# Follow PHASE1_QUICKSTART.md
```

## 🎓 Positioning Statement

> **NEXUS** is the first AI agent orchestration platform that treats **compliance as a feature, not an afterthought**.
>
> While competitors focus on "more tokens" or "more models", we deliver:
> - **Immutable audit trails** for every agent decision
> - **Declarative guardrails** enforced at runtime
> - **Multi-jurisdictional compliance** (LGPD, GDPR, AI Act) out-of-the-box
> - **Cost tracking** integrated into every workflow
>
> **Target**: FinTechs, HealthTechs, LegalTechs requiring AI agents with compliance guarantees

---

**Status**: ✅ Ready to begin Phase 1
**Next Action**: Follow PHASE1_QUICKSTART.md Week 1 instructions
**Timeline**: 16 weeks to Series A pitch
